## The Story

I used to be a heavy [Noteplan](https://noteplan.co/) user before switching to [Craft Docs](https://www.craft.do/). The one thing I missed? **The timeblocking view.** Being able to see my entire day laid out visually was invaluable for focus and time awareness.

Now, thanks to the new [Craft Imagine API](https://developer.craft.do/) (and some Claude Code sorcery), I have it again.

## Features

- **Visual Timeline**: See your day from 6 AM to 10 PM (configurable)
- **Drag & Drop**: Reschedule timeblocks by dragging them around
- **Resize**: Adjust duration by dragging the top or bottom edge
- **Date Navigation**: Browse through days with arrow buttons or keyboard shortcuts
- **Fuzzy Time Parsing**: Flexible format support (see below)
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Styled with Claude Desktop's color palette
- **Touch Support**: Works great on iPad and iPhone
- **Zero Dependencies**: Single HTML file, no build step required

### Flexible Time Formats

The parser understands many natural time formats:

```
10:00 AM - 11:00 AM - Team standup     # Full format
10-11 AM - Team standup                 # Shared AM/PM, no minutes
10 AM to 11 AM - Deep work              # "to" separator
14:00 -> 15:00 - Code review            # 24-hour with arrow
2:30 PM - 3:00 PM: Client call          # Colon before task
9-10 AM Meeting with design             # Space before task
```

Supports `-`, `–`, `—`, `to`, `->`, and `→` as time separators.
Supports `-`, `:`, or just a space before the task name.

## Suggested Use

### Desktop: Split Screen
Run Craft Timeblock side-by-side with Craft Docs. Update your daily note in Craft, hit refresh in Timeblock to see changes.

### iPad/iPhone: Second Screen
Keep Timeblock open on a separate device next to your main screen. Add to Home Screen for an app-like experience:

1. Open in Safari
2. Tap Share button
3. Select "Add to Home Screen"

### Local File
Download `index.html` and open directly in your browser. No server required.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

You need the [Craft Imagine](https://developer.craft.do/) Daily Notes API running. This provides the API bridge between this viewer and your Craft documents.

### Quick Start

1. Set up and run [Craft Imagine](https://developer.craft.do/)
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (or visit your hosted version)
3. Enter your Craft Imagine API URL
4. Your daily note's timeblocks appear on the timeline

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `←` | Previous day |
| `→` | Next day |
| `R` | Refresh |
| `N` | New unscheduled task |
| `,` | Open settings |
| `Esc` | Close modal / Cancel edit |

## Writing Timeblocks in Craft

**Pro tip:** Create an event note from your calendar in Craft. It automatically appears on your daily note and gets picked up as a timeblock!

Or write time ranges manually in any of these formats:

```markdown
## Schedule

10:00 AM - 11:30 AM - Deep work session
11:30 - 12 PM - Team standup
2 PM to 3:30 PM: Project planning
15:00 -> 16:00 - Code review

## Tasks (unscheduled)

- [ ] Review pull requests
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Reply to emails
```

Timeblocks are automatically categorized and color-coded based on keywords:
- **Work** (blue): work, project, code, review, build, deploy...
- **Meeting** (orange): meeting, call, sync, standup, 1:1...
- **Personal** (purple): personal, errand, home, family...
- **Health** (green): gym, workout, run, yoga, meditate...

## Configuration

Open Settings (gear icon or `,` key) to:
- Switch between dark and light themes
- Adjust timeline start and end hours
- Update your Craft Connect API URL

Settings are stored in localStorage.

## Technical Details

- **Single File**: Everything in one `index.html`
- **No Build Step**: Open directly in browser
- **No Dependencies**: Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Theme**: Uses CSS custom properties with Claude Desktop's color palette

## Roadmap

Future enhancements being considered:

- **Move Timeblocks Between Days**: Drag a block to tomorrow or next week
- **Seven-Day View**: See your entire week at a glance
- **iCal/Google Calendar Sync**: Pull in external calendar events
- **Recurring Timeblocks**: Templates for daily/weekly routines
- **Time Tracking**: Log actual time spent vs planned
- **Pomodoro Integration**: Built-in focus timer
